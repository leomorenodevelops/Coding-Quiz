# Coding-Quiz

## Description
This is a project that allowed me to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript with all code written from scratch. I used those skills to make a Timed Coding Quiz. This is a website which allows the user to start a coding quiz by clicking the start button and going through a series of questions with multiple answer button choices. At the end of the quiz user will be presented with his/her/their score and be able to submit the score to be saved on the highscore list.

I learned a lot during this project by being able to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a more functional, interactive yet also responsive interface. I learned to be able to traverse the DOM and how I can remove and add classes to display the interface I want the user to see. Also learned on how to set a timer with an array of questions that are presented and how to save a score to the local storage.

## Installation
